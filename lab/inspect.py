"""Portal read-only hash inspection.

Given a hash, return everything a reader is entitled to know about the receipt — its
metadata, its canonical nine slots, its validation status, and *safe* source refs (the
hashes it points at) — and **nothing that mutates state**. This surface is the read side
of the portal: no ``register``, no ``dispatch``, no ``close``, no ``append``. It opens the
database read-only and only ever issues ``SELECT``s.

Why a dedicated surface instead of just ``store.get``: ``get`` returns the raw act;
inspection answers the portal's actual question — "is this Act real, valid, and what does
it reference?" — without handing the caller a writable connection or any verb that could
advance the ledger. The two are deliberately separate so a read-only consumer (a viewer, an
auditor, an LLM proposing over history) is *structurally* unable to write.

A "safe source ref" is a hash this receipt cites or descends from, surfaced so a reader can
walk provenance — never a capability. We surface the citation (if present, validated), the
AUX provenance hashes the receipt carries (``this`` when it is a hash, ``process_contract_hash``,
``result_hash``, ``parent_*`` hashes), and — when the source ref is itself present in the
ledger — a note that it resolves. We never *follow* a ref into a mutation.
