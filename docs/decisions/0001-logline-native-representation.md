# ADR-0001 — LogLine-native digestion of contracts, norms, and specs

## Purpose

Freeze, in one authoritative place, what we understand about LogLine and the Lab — from the
Foundation canon to the external-standards research — and to correct an ontological error in
the first draft of this record, so that both the existing and future implementation get better
and the real bootstrap becomes *assembly, not invention*.

This document is, deliberately, only a seed and a projection of itself: the rough human
material an LLM digests into one or more LogLine Acts, and the human-readable rendering those
Acts can later project back into. The truth is the registered Act, not this file.

## Correction being made

The first draft framed the Lab as if the document were the noble body that later "receives an
envelope" or "becomes a receipt" — *human-readable body over machine-readable envelope*. That
is backwards.

**The Lab is not document-native. The Lab is LogLine-native.** Markdown is either pre-LogLine
rough material or post-LogLine projection. The native object is the LogLine Act: human material
*digested* into structured processual form. The processual envelope comes *after* the Act, to
situate it for routing, activation, transport, attention, supersession, or consequence. The
registered receipt is custody; the Markdown document is a projection.

This ADR therefore supersedes three concepts (see `aux.supersedes_concepts`):
`markdown-as-canonical-body`, `document-first-receipt-later`, and
`body-over-envelope-as-primary-model`.

## Context

The Lab is Dan's private implementation of the LogLine method (the LogLine Foundation is
separate; Dan created it). Everything must be **LogLine-Foundation canon in form and spirit**,
processually grounded in **Universal Inbox v3/v4/v5**. The Lab is generic infrastructure to
organize Dan's life, computers, research, and businesses — not a product for others.

The epistemic motive matters and must be stated. A human needed to model and compress the chaos
of daily life; even the computer could not do it — until a grammar specialist did. LogLine is a
way to **freeze human intention** statically, cheaply, and simply, with **very small loss when
the freezing is performed by an LLM**. The nine slots and AUX are not metadata bolted onto a
document; they are *the organizing of an LLM's thought* — the natural grammar by which language
becomes act-structure. The power of LogLine lives precisely there.

A concrete gap surfaced during Day 2: process contracts live as disk files
(`processes/*.v1.yml`), the rules that matter are real fields but the rationale is YAML
comments (silently dropped by the parser and absent from any hash), and **nothing is digested
into the ledger**. For contracts and norms to be valid and consultable in production (Supabase),
they must be Acts, not files.

## Native ground (what the canon already legislates)

From `LAB FINAL SPEC v0.md` and the LLM-facing canon:

- **The receipt is the truth; projections, columns, views are maps** (§5, :224). A file may
  *initiate* the digestion and a file may *render* the result, but the file is not the
  institutional truth.
- **Receipt discipline**: nine stable slots (`who, did, this, when, confirmed_by, if_ok,
  if_doubt, if_not, status`) + **AUX** + **tuple_hash** + **content_hash** + **JCS/RFC8785**
  canonicalization + append-only custody (§5, :228–247). Consequence may not be smuggled into
  forbidden top-level fields (`transport`/`result`/`evidence`); transport belongs to the
  **envelope** boundary (`envelope_hash`).
- **Composition is citation-by-hash**: *"Evidence is records or evidence objects cited by
  records"* (:254); evaluation asks *"Are cited hashes resolvable?"* (:291); *"Cite before
  claiming"* (:1561). Resolvability of cited hashes is already an activation gate.
- **Registration ≠ activation**: everything may register; only complete records matching a
  registered process contract activate; evaluation **classifies, does not reject** (§6).
- **A process is a contract, not a daemon** (§8, :400), carrying `…danger tier, grant
  requirements, evidence obligation, … version, supersession` (:404–423). New capability is
  added by *adding/updating contracts, schemas, adapters, projections — not new daemons* (:433).
- **Closure states** include `fechado, doubted, ghost, retired, superseded` (§9, :460–467):
  supersession is a first-class lifecycle — the cadence of rules.
- **Universal Inbox v3 Awakening law**: *"Address canonically if you want to be heard."*

## The wrong model

```text
human writes a document
  -> the document is the canonical body
  -> later it "gets an envelope"
  -> later it "becomes a receipt"
```

This treats Markdown as canonical content and the problem as documental representation. It
makes the file the truth and the Act an afterthought. It is rejected.

## The corrected model

Human material is digested into LogLine-native Acts. Markdown is either pre-LogLine rough
material or post-LogLine projection. The semantic and processual content is digested into one
or more LogLine Acts; any Markdown body is source material, evidence, or projection — never the
canonical body.

## The pipeline

```text
raw human material
  -> LLM digests
  -> LogLine Act (structured, native)
  -> processual envelope / route / activation / transport
  -> receipt registered in the ledger (custody)
  -> human projections, including Markdown
```

Raw human material may be: speech, draft, rough Markdown, conversation, audio, image, code, a
human contract, a desire, an informal decision, an aesthetic correction, a doubt, a memory.

LLM digestion performs: interpretation, separation, naming, structuring, decomposition,
intent detection, doubt preservation, process identification, AUX formation, and the proposal
of one or more LogLine Acts.

## What is a LogLine Act in this decision

The native, structured form — the frozen intention:

```text
who
did
this
when
confirmed_by
if_ok
if_doubt
if_not
status
AUX
```

Contracts, norms, specs, grants, decisions, vocabularies, results, and evidence become
Lab-native when they are digested into LogLine Acts and then registered, cited, evaluated,
activated, or projected according to process. They are not "documents that get stored"; they
are intentions frozen into act-structure.

## What is the processual envelope

Posterior to, and distinct from, the Act. It situates an existing Act for movement and
consequence:

```text
process
route
contract
activation
transport
sent_to
runtime
idempotency
grants
evidence obligation
projection target
supersession target
```

The Act says *what was meant*; the envelope says *where it goes and how it may move*. The
envelope never precedes the structure it carries.

## What Markdown is and is not

```text
Markdown IS:        rough human material (a seed) OR a human-readable projection
Markdown IS NOT:    the canonical body, the institutional truth, or the unit of custody
```

A readable document, a rendered spec, a human ADR, a preview, a report, an explanation, an
index, a UI surface — all are projections of registered Acts, not the Acts themselves.

## Role of the LLM

The LLM is not merely extracting metadata from a document; it is performing the natural LogLine
digestion of language into act-structure. This is the epistemic act at the center of the
method: the LLM is the low-loss freezer of human intention. It interprets, structures, names,
decomposes, detects intent, and — crucially — **preserves doubt** (as `if_doubt`, attention, or
an open reconciliation) rather than discarding it. The human directs, judges, corrects, and
chooses format; the LLM digests, investigates, structures, warns, and proposes.

## External standards as confirmation, not containers

The external standards confirm parts of the *process* and lend *vocabulary*. They do not become
the container; the LogLine Act remains the native form.

- **in-toto / SLSA** confirms the digest/evidence/envelope vocabulary (envelope + subject by
  digest + typed predicate). LogLine independently has this shape; the confirmation is welcome,
  the import is not.
- **W3C VC / DID** confirms grant/issuer/subject/status vocabulary; a grant is an Act, not a
  foreign credential object.
- **Cedar / OPA** confirms authorization vocabulary (principal/action/resource/context) — the
  *model*, never the engine, which would never enter the zero-dependency kernel.
- **CUE / JSON Schema** confirms validation vocabulary for the Act/contract shape.
- **Structured-MADR** confirms decision/rationale vocabulary — the reason a decision Act carries
  its rationale as data.

## Rationale is data

A comment is only a human convenience. It does not survive parsing and does not enter the
canonical hash; it is invisible to the Lab. If a reason matters to the Lab it must be one of:

```text
an AUX field
a cited Act
an evidence record
a norm reference
a decision reference
a projection with input hashes
```

The YAML comments added to contracts on Day 2 are, by this law, not yet institutional; they are
rough material awaiting digestion into AUX or into cited norm/decision Acts.

## Decision (the laws this record sets)

1. **The Lab is LogLine-native, not document-native.**
2. **Markdown is rough material before digestion or projection after digestion** — never the
   canonical body.
3. **LLM digestion produces LogLine Acts** — the natural freezing of language into act-structure.
4. **The LogLine Act is the native structured form** (nine slots + AUX, JCS-canonical,
   content-addressed).
5. **The processual envelope situates the Act after structure exists** (route, activation,
   transport, attention, supersession, consequence).
6. **Registered receipts provide custody/truth**; files seed or render, they do not hold truth.
7. **Composition is by hash** — contracts, authorities, sources, evidence, and superseded norms
   are cited by `content_hash`; resolvability is an activation gate.
8. **Supersession is append-only** — a new version is a new Act citing and superseding the
   prior by hash; old Acts are never edited in place.
9. **Rationale is data** — if it matters, it lives in AUX or a cited Act, never in a comment.
10. **External standards lend vocabulary only** — they confirm shapes; they are never the
    container.

## Representation / digestion pass

The central correction, expressed as work. The order matters and each step compounds:

```text
1. Identify the rough human materials (the contracts, notes, norms, playbooks we already wrote).
2. Ask the LLM to digest them into candidate LogLine Acts.
3. Preserve ambiguity as if_doubt / attention / open_reconciliations — never discard it.
4. Validate the Act shape (against the receipt/contract schema).
5. Attach or cite the source-material hash (a file initiates; the Act remembers its seed).
6. Register accepted Acts as receipts in the ledger.
7. Generate Markdown projections FROM the registered Acts.
8. Build spec/contract/norm projections from the ledger — not the reverse.
```

Dependency-light, canon-native, and mapped onto the roadmap: **Day 4** (Projection Spec
Registry + Spec Schema; projections already carry a `projection_spec_hash`), **Day 7**
(Knowledge Pack / Bootstrap Book), **Day 8** (genesis registers specs; genesis already carries a
`spec_hash`).

## Consequences

- **Better existing implementation**: contracts gain self-describing, registerable canon;
  rationale stops being invisible; the danger/mold vocabularies stop being hardcoded constants
  and become cited vocabulary Acts.
- **Better future implementation**: the bootstrap becomes "digest the seeds into Acts and
  resolve by hash" — no bespoke engine to invent. Supply-chain interop (in-toto/SLSA tooling) is
  available for free because the shape already matches.
- **The Dream Machine UI is not a Markdown editor first.** It is a **LogLine digestion IDE**:
  - the **Ledger column** shows registered Acts;
  - the **Projections column** shows ladders and dynamic projections;
  - the **Preview column** renders human-readable output (incl. Markdown) from Acts/projections;
  - **LLM prompt boxes** are situated by column/context;
  - the **human** directs, judges, corrects, and chooses format; the **LLM** digests,
    investigates, structures, warns, and proposes.
- **Cost / risk**: a one-time digestion pass; a risk of over-formalizing — mitigated by keeping
  engines out of the kernel and treating standards as vocabulary only.

## Open reconciliations

1. How much raw source material is stored inline vs. cited by hash?
2. Which `did` families are official for digested Acts (e.g. `process-contract`, `norm`,
   `decision`, `vocabulary`)?
3. How is source-material hash / body hash represented alongside the Act?
4. How do we reconcile **Universal Inbox v4 and v5** into the digestion vocabulary? (This record
   is grounded mainly in v3 + the FINAL SPEC.)
5. When does a *candidate* Act become *registered* truth?
6. How are Markdown projections regenerated deterministically from Acts?
7. How are corrections/supersessions represented without editing old Acts?

## Status

`registered` / accepted. This is the north-star for the digestion pass. Supersede only by a
later `did=decision` receipt that cites this record's hash — never by edit-in-place.
